//! # Bastion: Fault-tolerant Runtime for Rust applications
//! [![Bastion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastion-rs/bastion/master/img/bastion.png)](https://github.com/bastion-rs/bastion)
//!
//!
//!
//! Bastion is a highly-available, fault-tolerant runtime system
//! with dynamic dispatch oriented lightweight process model.
//! It supplies actor model like concurrency with primitives
//! called [lightproc] and utilize all the system resources
//! efficiently with at-most-once message delivery guarantee.
//!
//! To have a quick start please head to: [Bastion System Documentation](struct.Bastion.html).
//!
//! ## Features
//! * Message-based communication makes this project a lean mesh of actor system.
//!     * Without web servers, weird shenanigans, forced trait implementations, and static dispatch.
//! * Runtime fault-tolerance makes it a good candidate for distributed systems.
//!     * If you want the smell of Erlang and the powerful aspects in Rust. That's it!
//! * Completely asynchronous runtime with NUMA-aware and cache-affine SMP executor.
//!     * Exploiting hardware locality wherever it is possible. It is designed for servers.
//! * Supervision system makes it easy to manage lifecycles.
//!     * Kill your application in certain condition or restart you subprocesses whenever a certain condition is met.
//!
//! ## Guarantees
//! * At most once delivery for all the messages.
//! * Completely asynchronous system design.
//! * Asynchronous program boundaries with [fort].
//! * Dynamic supervision of supervisors (adding a subtree later during the execution)
//! * Lifecycle management both at `futures` and `lightproc` layers.
//! * Faster middleware development.
//! * Above all "fault-tolerance".
//!
//! ## Why Bastion?
//! If one of the questions below is answered with yes, then Bastion is just for you:
//! * Do I need fault-tolerance in my project?
//! * Do I need to write resilient middleware/s?
//! * I shouldn't need a webserver to run an actor system, right?
//! * Do I want to make my existing code unbreakable?
//! * Do I need an executor which is using system resources efficiently?
//! * Do I have some trust issues with orchestration systems?
//! * Do I want to implement my own application lifecycle?
//!
